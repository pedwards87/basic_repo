	<h1>Here we go adding some content</h1>
	<p>Coding dojo is enjoyable to learn from. I think adding a little more content to the Jquery portion in regards to using mutliple functions and joining concepts would be handy.</p>

	<h3>What do I know!</h3>
	<p>So far in all of my schooling which is very minimal I have learned more in the 4 weeks attending your online schools than I have learned from any other formal schooling I have attanded.</p>

	<h3>What I do and why I am here</h3>
	<p> I manage one of the larges independant Jewelry stores in the west coast. For the past 8 months we have been working with a web developer to creat us a new looking website and integrate that site into our current inventory system. 8 months later we still have nothing. Granted the initial investment was minimal I have decided to learn the tools I need to bring our store into at least the 90's an maybe further.</p>

	<p>Your teachings are already being put to use. I will keep coding dojo informed on our advancments provided by what I have learned here. I hope to make my store more efficient and prodcutive while making coding dojo proud.</p>
